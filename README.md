# diff-eqs-plotter

Just an old project in Delphi written in the first term of studying in university. Nothing interesting here.

This program simply plots phase portrait of given system of two differential equations on the 2D phase plane. This project is
really old, and it's written on freaking Delphi. Therefore this project is not being developed anymore.
